            How do you get to Wonderland
            Over the hill or under land
            Or just behind a tree
            
            When clouds go rolling by
            They roll away and leave the sky
            Where is the land behind the eye
            People cannot see
            
            Where can you see
            Where do the stars go
            Where is the crescent moon
            They must be somewhere in the sunny afternoon
            
            Alice in Wonderland
            Where is the path to Wonderland
            Over the hill or here or there
            I wonder where
